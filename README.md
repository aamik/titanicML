## Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning classification demonstration using the renowned Titanic dataset. The dataset encapsulates details about the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic ship, focusing on their survival outcome.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a historical collection of records that has been widely analyzed within the data science community. It includes various passenger attributes such as age, fare, class, and survival status.

## Feature Engineering
We enhance the dataset by introducing six novel features, derived from existing data, to provide a richer context for our predictive models. These features are meticulously visualized to underscore their distribution and potential impact on the model's performance.

## Data Preprocessing
The data undergoes a rigorous standardization and encoding process, ensuring that it is in an optimal format for model training. This step is crucial for aligning feature scales and encoding categorical variables.

## Model Training
Two robust machine learning models are employed:
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A versatile ensemble method known for its high accuracy and resistance to overfitting.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: A non-parametric method that classifies instances based on the majority vote of their neighbors.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the Random Forest and kNN models is meticulously evaluated using a variety of metrics. We compare their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective predictor for the Titanic dataset.

## Conclusions
The analysis culminates in drawing insightful conclusions about the predictive capabilities of the models. We discuss the implications of feature engineering and model selection on the outcome of the predictions.
