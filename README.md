## Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning classification demonstration using the renowned Titanic dataset. The dataset provides details about the passengers aboard the famous Titanic ship, focusing on their survival outcome.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a historical collection of records that has been widely analyzed within the data science community. It includes various passenger attributes such as age, fare, class, and survival status.

## Feature Engineering
We enhance the dataset by introducing six novel features, derived from existing data, to provide a richer context for our predictive models. These features are visualized to underscore their distribution and potential impact on the model's performance.

## Model Training
Two machine learning models are employed:
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A versatile ensemble method known for its high accuracy and resistance to overfitting.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: A non-parametric method that classifies instances based on the majority vote of their neighbors.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the Random Forest and kNN models is evaluated using a variety of metrics. We compare their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective predictor for the Titanic dataset.
